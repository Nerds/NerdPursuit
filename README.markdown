## NerdPursuit

Everybody loves question & answer games, but none of those let nerdism 
shine. This repo gathers nerd-questions, so everybody can play geeky  
questions-answer games and check the nerd level of your buddies.

## Participate

Simply fork this repo, add your questions and send us a pull request. 
Comment commits and pull requests or create a ticket.

Thanks to marcinbunsch, who created a commandline interface to create new 
questions(he hates writing json). Start it with:

    ./creator [sub_category]

## Tech

Questions are submitted as JSON, with one question per file and MUST 
align with our [JSON-Schema](https://github.com/Nerds/NerdPursuit/blob/master/schema/question.json). We have setup travis-ci which automatically 
tests all questions.

You should run the tests before sending us a pull-request:

    bundle install
    bundle exec ruby validate_all.rb

## How to Play

The first game is out, go check it at:

http://hackerspursuit.com

Presented by 9elements & Railslove it is also [available on github](https://github.com/9elements/hackerspursuit)

Got another use-case? Show us your game, recruitment test, print-api, nerd-captcha or whatever you came up with.
